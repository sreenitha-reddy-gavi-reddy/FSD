	<h1> Sai Deepika</h1>

		<p>
		My Masters degree from UTS Australia, the best university in the continent, has given me deeper understanding and insight into the education system. This was coupled with the ideology of my father which enabled me to take the onus of steering Aditya. In succession, Aditya technical campus, Surampalem has been established to offer professional education in engineering, technology, management and pharmacy with the core concept of quality and excellence.
